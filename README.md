Descent of the Apocalypse Lord - (Invocation and Defeat)

- (Sabaoth) -
"Great forces of the Triangle,
I appeal to you in this very moment,
Now that my sons lie on the ground,
Eyeless and slaughtered;
Grant me your power and I will pass
A thousand years in weakness,
I'll sacrifice to you my heart,
If defeated will be the King;
I'll offer you my victory,
If victory will be;
So I summon you now by the secret words
OM MANI ITA"

- (Triangle Sovereigns) -
"The apocalyptic clash
Will now reach his end,
We grant you victory,
We'll strike the land with lightstreams;
In one breath the dark King
Will fall in defeat;
So we'll take your heart and force
For a thousand years"

- (The King) -
"Lightstreams from the sky
Each for a Vrill to be dead,
And 6 over me are 6 wounds
To be revenged,
But I won't disappear
Died in a so great shame;
And SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE
I cry all my pain"
